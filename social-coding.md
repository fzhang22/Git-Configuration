# Social Coding
## Introduction
You can interact with people, repositories, and organizations on GitHub. See what others are working on and who they're connecting with from your personal dashboard.

## Collaboration

* Contribute to project by giving pull request

## Some useful commands

`cd /c/zf/SIT/Github` 
`git clone git@github.com:fzhang22/starter-web.git`

Secondly, let's create a branch locally
`git checkout -b feature-readme`

Thirdly,push the modification to Github
`git push -u origin feature-readme`
